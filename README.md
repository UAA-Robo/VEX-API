# VexCode API
This is UAA Robotic's documentation of the VexCode API! It's a work in progress.

### Contributing
Currently, contribution is only open to UAA Robotics members. However, soon we 
will open this documentation up for other teams to contribute.
<br> <br>

**Setup.** 
To edit, install docsify-cli to preview the website pages locally using `npm i docsify-cli -g`. Once installed, clone the [github repo](https://github.com/UAA-Robo/VEX-API). Then in that directory run `docsify serve` to preview the site locally in your browser.
<br> <br>

**Formatting.**
To add classes or functions to this repo, please follow the cpp/template.md format.
Please use function and parameter descriptions from the actual comments in the vexCode code (as viewed in VSCode with the VEX extension). Use vex type descriptions that are in the [VEXcode API](https://api.vexcode.cloud/v5/namespace/namespacevex). 

Keep examples simple. Use comments if you add specific parameters. Don't use `using namespace vex`.
Make sure examples run before adding them.
<br> <br>
After you edit the md files on github, and push to the main branch, your changes
will automatically be deployed to the documentation website.
